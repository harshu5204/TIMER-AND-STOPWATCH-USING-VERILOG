# TIMER-AND-STOPWATCH-USING-VERILOG
The purpose of the digital stopwatch and timer is to measure the amount of time that passes between the beginning and end of an event. In addition to representing both start and pause, the stopwatch and timer also features four seven-segment displays on the FPGA board, RESET, and START.Numerous applications include traffic signals, temperature indicators, alarms, and indicators. 

I have also uploaded my report for other basic knowledge about this project like RTL view etc.
